# org-news
A mobile app for organizations to publish updates to its members.

This app is based on Angular, Ionic Framework , and Cordova.
It allows users to subscribe to your organization's news/blog/audio feeds.  It queries a REST endpoint and 
shows the user a list of items (generically reffered to as articles).  Each article can contact media or
images.  Each article has a required set of fields (e.g. article ID, title and body) and several optional fields (media, author).
